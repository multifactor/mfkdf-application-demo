This repository illustrates how to use MFKDF to build a strong centralized password management application featuring multi-factor key derivation with advanced key derivation policies, factor persistence, self-service key recovery, MFKDF-based authentication, and end-to-end encryption. The application exists for demonstration purposes only. It has not been tested/audited as thoroughly as the core MFKDF library, and is not intended to be used as a production-ready application.
